# We need to find value of x when y is given. Also we are given two linear equations. 
# But we need to find the value of x when y is given (i.e. y is independant) which 
# corresponds to the line of x on y(2nd eq). So put the given value of y in 2nd equation 
# and find x.

# 2nd equation
 20x – 9y – 107 = 0
 # Given y value is 7, and we need to find x
 X value leads to - 8.5
